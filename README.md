# ML Tales
This is a repo with some Jupyter notebooks to get people interested in ML and AI.
The first notebook is an implementation of a very simple classifier using the PIMA dataset.
After an exploratory study in which we see some correlation between variables, then we train a support vector Machine using the SK-learn library.
